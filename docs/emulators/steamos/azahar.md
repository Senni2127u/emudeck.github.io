## Getting Started with Azahar
[Back to the Top](#azahar-table-of-contents)

Azahar is a fairly straight-forward emulator to set up. Place your ROMs in `Emulation/roms/n3ds` or `Emulation/roms/3ds`. Read the [Configuration](#azahar-configuration) section to learn more about Azahar and its folder locations. The [Configuration](#azahar-configuration).

To launch your ROMs in game mode, use Steam ROM Manager and use one of the following parsers to play your Azahar ROMs:

* `EmulationStation-DE`
* `Nintendo 3DS - Azahar` 
* `Emulators`


***

### Azahar Configuration
[Back to the Top](#azahar-table-of-contents)

* Type of Emulator: AppImage
* Config Location: 
    * `/home/deck/.config/azahar-emu`
    * `/home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu`
* ROM Location: `Emulation/roms/3ds` or `Emulation/roms/n3ds`
* Saves Location:
    * Symlink: `Emulation/saves/azahar/saves`
    * Target: `/Emulation/storage/azahar/sdmc`
* Save States Location:
    * Symlink: `Emulation/saves/azahar/states/`
    * Target: `/home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu/states`

**Note:** `~/.config` and `~/.local` are hidden folders by default. In Dolphin (file manager), click the hamburger menu in the top right, click `Show Hidden Files` to see these folders.

#### Works With
* Steam ROM Manager
* ES-DE

***

### Azahar Folder Locations
[Back to the Top](#azahar-table-of-contents)

These file locations apply regardless of where you chose to install EmuDeck (to your internal SSD, to your SD Card, or elsewhere). Some emulator configuration files will be located on the internal SSD as listed below. 

`$HOME` refers to your home folder. If you are on a Steam Deck, this folder will be named `/home/deck` (you will likely not see `deck` in the file path when navigating using the file manager). 

Paths beginning with `Emulation/..` correspond to your EmuDeck install location. If you installed on an SD Card, your path may be `/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/roms/..`. If you installed on your internal SSD, your path may be `/home/deck/Emulation/roms/..`

**Note:** Folders with a `.` (`.var`, `.local`, `.config`, etc.) at the beginning are hidden by default. In Dolphin (file manager), click the hamburger menu in the top right, click `Show Hidden Files` to see these folders.

`/home/deck/.config/azahar-emu`

## Azahar Common Issues
[Back to the Top](#azahar-table-of-contents)

***

### Why did my game suddenly stop working? 
[Back to the Top](#azahar-table-of-contents)

If your game ever crashes or you exit the game by pressing the `STEAM` button and clicking `Exit Game` instead of using the hotkey (`Quit` on the left trackpad), you may end up corrupting the shader cache. 

To clear the shader cache:

1. In Desktop Mode, open the `/home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu` folder
    * `~/.local` is a hidden folder by default. In Dolphin (file manager), click the hamburger menu in the top right, click `Show Hidden Files` to see these folders
2. Delete the `shaders` folder
3. Try your game again

**Note:** Use the `Select` + `Start` hotkey to exit your game instead of using the `STEAM` button.

**Note:** `Preload Custom Textures` is no longer recommended. Leave `Preload Custom Textures` off

#### How to Install Custom Textures

**Note:** Your texture pack may already come properly named and packaged with the correct `TitleID` and texture files. You may place the included texture pack folder directly into `/home/deck/.local/share/azahar-emu/textures/`. You do not need the following section if this is the case.

1. In Desktop Mode, open [https://3ds.jdbye.com/?details=USA&split=0&display=0](https://3ds.jdbye.com/?details=USA&split=0&display=0) in a browser

    * `~/.local` is a hidden folder by default. In Dolphin (file manager), click the hamburger menu in the top right, click `Show Hidden Files` to see these folders
4. In the `textures` folder from Step 3, create a folder matching the `TitleID` from Step 2
5. Put your texture files directly into the `TitleID` folder you created in Step 4
6. Your texture pack should now be installed

!!! tip
    
    Consider enabling `Preload Custom Textures`. This may help performance in some cases.

### How to Configure Bottom Screen With PiP and Opacity
[Back to the Top](#azahar-table-of-contents)

Credit: `NexLevel`

A previous update of Citra that Azahar has now used allows the ability to set the opacity on the bottom screen. In combination with setting the bottom screen as a PiP overlay, you can create a Azahar layout that looks like the following: 

**Example 1:** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/219829080-3e871ada-cde0-44b5-9781-0294a9a9fc7b.png" height="300">

**Example 2:** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/219829095-8fe0e1e9-aa15-4750-b917-899373ce10e7.png" height="300">
 
**Here's How**

1. Open the folder: `/home/deck/.config/azahar-emu/`

## Azahar's Online Features

***
### How to Set Up System Files

* Make sure you have your Nintendo 3DS, as this process requires it.
* To install New 3DS system software, you need to download Old 3DS software first, this is required for some situations (such as Pretendo Network), so it's best to download both.
* The system used does not matter in this instance either, you can download New 3DS software with an old 3DS, and vice versa.

1. Take out your SD Card and plug it into your PC.

2. Download the Azahar Setup Tool from the respective GitHub page, and place it in your cia or 3ds folder on the SD card. [https://github.com/azahar-emu/ArticSetupTool/releases](https://github.com/azahar-emu/ArticSetupTool/releases)

3. Insert your SD Card back into the Nintendo 3DS and power it on, launch the Setup Tool, instructions will vary depending on your chosen file.

* If you used the .3dsx, you need to launch it via the Homebrew Launcher.
* If you used the .cia, you need to install it with FBI.

4. Press A to start the setup tool, you will be given a local IP address once completed.

5. Launch Azahar, then File > Setup System Files, you will be prompted for a local IP address, type in the address displayed on the 3DS, and press OK.

6. You will be taken to the System Update screen if everything was done correctly, follow the prompts and wait for it to update.

7. Once successfully updated, confirm the update.

You should now have your system files ready to go.

### How to Set Up your Nintendo Network ID

* Do note this process may make you unable to access certain features of Pretendo Network, such as Miiverse.
* This process requires atleast Old 3DS system software files, if you have not already done so, you can do so with the instructions in the [How To Set Up System Files](#how_to_setup_system_files) tab.

1. Download ThreeSD from the respective GitHub page and for your OS: [https://github.com/zhaowenlan1779/threeSD/releases](https://github.com/zhaowenlan1779/threeSD/releases)

2. Insert your 3DS SD Card into your computer and in the dist folder of the ThreeSD zip, copy the threeSDDumper.gm9 into your gm9/scripts folder on your SD Card. Eject the SD Card and put it back into your Nintendo 3DS.

3. Launch GodMode9 by holding the Start button then powering the Nintendo 3DS on.

4. Press the Home Button, Scripts, and then execute the threeSDDumper script. Once it is done, power off your 3DS and put the SD Card back into your PC and launch the threeSD executable.

5. After that click your SD card, uncheck everything but Ungrouped, and transfer the data.

* This data gets saved to the CITRA user save directory, not Azahar, so you need to locate this directory.

* for SteamOS and most Linux distros, it's located in `Home/.local/share`, but you can also locate it by launching Azahar and going to File > Open Azahar Folder, then go back one folder.
  
* Check where your SDMC folder is located, usually, they will be located in Azahar's folder, move the two newly created folders into that same directory displayed in Emulation > Configure > System > Storage.

6. Next, you need to link your NNID, make sure you have your ID, password, and email ready.

7. Launch Azahar, go into Emulation > Configure, then the System tab, and enable required LLE modules for online features.

8. Boot the Home Menu by going to File > Boot Home Menu > (Region of your Nintendo 3DS).
   
9.  Launch the System Settings app, Nintendo Network ID Settings, then follow the prompts until you are at the screen that either says `Existing ID` Or `Create New ID`, you want to hit the `Existing ID` button.

10. Type in your ID, Password, and email associated with the NNID.

After following the prompts, you should now have access to the Nintendo EShop or Pokémon Bank.

### How to Set Up Pretendo Network

* This process requires both the old and New 3DS system software files, if you have not already done so, you can do so with the instructions in the [How To Set Up System Files](#how_to_setup_system_files) tab.
* Do note that if you have a NNID installed for usage of Pokémon Bank or the Nintendo EShop, you may not be able to use features that require an ID via Pretendo Network, which right now, is Miiverse.

1. Download the .cia version of Nimbus from the respective github. [https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/nimbus/releases](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/nimbus/releases)

2. Launch Azahar, go to File > Open Azahar Folder, and move both the luma and 3ds folder into the sdmc folder.

3. Back to Azahar, go to File > Install CIA, select the Nimbus.cia file, and it should now be installed.

4. Go to Emulation > Configure, then the System tab, you need to enable the required LLE modules for online features, this should be at the top of the System Settings section.

5. Afterwards, boot into the home menu by going to File > Boot Home Menu > (Region of your Nintendo 3DS).

6. Run the newly installed Nimbus program, and select Pretendo, it should take you back to the Home Menu.
